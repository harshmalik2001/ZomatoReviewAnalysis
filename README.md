# Zomato Review Analysis using Natural Language Processing
This project is focused on analyzing the Zomato Review Kaggle dataset using Natural Language Processing techniques. The dataset contains information on restaurant reviews from the Zomato app in India. The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict the sentiment of a given review and provide insights into the features that are most important to customers when rating a restaurant.
# Approach
The following steps will be followed to analyze the dataset:

# Data Cleaning: The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed by removing missing values, duplicates and unwanted columns.
Sentiment Analysis: The reviews_list column will be used for sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: The features that are most important to customers when rating a restaurant will be extracted by analyzing the most frequent words and phrases in the reviews.
Model Building: A machine learning model will be built using the extracted features to predict the sentiment of a given review.
# Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
# Conclusion
The Zomato Review Kaggle dataset provides a rich source of information for analyzing restaurant reviews in India.
